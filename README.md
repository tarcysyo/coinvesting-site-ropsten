# Getting Started Coinvesting Exchange Token - COINVEX

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project contains a smart contract to create a token, ERC20, a smart contract for the sale of part of the respective tokens and a smart contract (multi signature wallet) for storage (freeze) of the other created tokens.

The front-end interface allows the user to interact with the smart contract to make purchases of tokens offered for sale.

Metamask Wallet is required.
